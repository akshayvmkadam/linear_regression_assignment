## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service that makes bikes available to people for short-term, shared use that can be paid for or provided for free. Many bike share programs enable users to pick up a bike from a "dock" that is typically computer-controlled, where they enter their payment information and the system unlocks the bike. Then, you can return this bike to a different system-affiliated dock.
- The ongoing Corona pandemic has recently caused a US bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, to experience significant drops in income. In the current market environment, it is extremely difficult for the organization to remain viable. Therefore, it has chosen to develop a careful business plan so that it may increase its revenue as soon as possible.

## Conclusions
- There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to service the bikes without having business impact.
- Company should focus on expanding business during September.
- Comparing the previous data, the demand increases when the situation is back to normal
- Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during spring when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best
